### mxdream (very early macOS Dreamcast emulator build)
This is a very early, experimental macOS build of the lxdream Sega Dreamcast emulator, shared just for fun. Expect rough edges, poor performance, and lots of things that donâ€™t work yet. Use at your own risk. BIOS/flash files are not included; you must provide your own and configure their paths in Preferences after launching the app. This project is unaffiliated with SEGA and provided under GPLv2.

### Build (macOS, Apple Silicon)
```bash
# Dependencies
brew install glib gettext pcre2 libpng libisofs

# Configure & build
./autogen.sh
mkdir build-arm64 && cd build-arm64
../configure --disable-gtkui
make -j

# Create an app bundle with bundled libraries
make macbundle

# Optional: create a DMG from the app bundle
hdiutil create -volname "mxdream" -srcfolder lxdream.app -ov -format UDZO mxdream.dmg
```
